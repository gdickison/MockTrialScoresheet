				Each team should have a teacher sponsor and an attorney coach, and must have a minimum of six and a maximum of nine team members. On the following pages please enter the name and contact information for each teacher sponsor and attorney coach.
			</p>

				For schools with more than one team, we encourage you to have separate teacher and attorney coaches for each team. But, if you are unable to provide separate coaches for each team, you may enter the same teacher sponsor or attorney coach name for each team.
			</p>
			<p>
				Please note: a teacher sponsor, attorney coach, or other supervising adult must be present during competitions for each team. For schools with two or three teams this means that each team must have a separate adult present with each team during the competition.

			<h3>Courtroom Artist</h3>
			<p>
				The Courtroom Artist Contest is open to students in grades 9 through 12, to allow artistically talented students the opportunity to participate in the mock trial program. Artists observe trials and submit sketches that depict actual courtroom scenes. The top six finishers from regional contests will be invited to participate in the state mock trial competition.
			</p>
			<p>
				Each mock trial team may register one courtroom artist per team (so if your school has three teams, you can enter up to 3 artists). A team does not have to have a named artist at the time of registration. An artist who participates with a team will still compete solely on their own efforts and will NOT be considered as part of their schoolâ€™s team in terms of advancing or not advancing to the state competition.
